This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
source("shotLog.R")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=450}
dat <- getShotLog("Stephen Curry", season = "2014-15")
heat.dat <- heat_data(dat)
heat_map(heat.dat)
```
